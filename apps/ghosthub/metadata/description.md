# 👻 GhostHub

**GhostHub** is a lightweight, modular media server that lets you swipe through your local videos and images in a sleek, mobile-friendly interface — with real-time chat, optional host sync, and easy Cloudflare Tunnel sharing.

Runs as a **Python script**, **one-click Windows `.exe`**, or **Docker container** — no install, no accounts, no cloud.
